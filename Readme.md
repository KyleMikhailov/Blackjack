### User Story

### Test Statements

### TO DO:
- Initial menu prompt/forms: Bankroll, Name, -maybe- Amount of Decks
- Fix card positioning: media responsiveness not set for card images!
- Could add some more responsiveness for screen height maybe; I don't know what to do about very small widths (sub 320px)

for fun:
- have blackjack bars fill up at intervals ? ? ?
