### TO DO:
- Initial menu prompt/forms: Bankroll, Name, -maybe- Amount of Decks
- Change betting logic: each button increments; can add to bet amount or just type in desired amount; can lower bet; reset bet to last amount after doubled down
- Improve dealing animation
- WAY more responsiveness! -- especially awful text
- "Can't surrender" prompt
