### TO DO:
- Initial menu prompt/forms: Bankroll, Name, -maybe- Amount of Decks
- Change betting logic: each button increments; can add to bet amount or just type in desired amount; can lower bet; reset bet to last amount after doubled down
- Improve dealing animation
- Reexamine Deal cursors; too cheesy?
- Bonus challenge for self: Pokemon-esque response messages to each action
  - shouldn't be TOO bad--just set its position to #dealBlock, change its text based on result, call it instead of showDeal(), have it call showDeal()
- WAY more responsiveness! -- especially awful text
- Card name and value shows when hovering over
- Improve logo!
